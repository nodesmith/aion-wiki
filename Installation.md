1. Download the latest Aion kernel release from the [releases page](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/releases). 

2. Unarchive the downloaded file by right clicking on it and selecting `Extract Here` from the drop-down menu. 
The `aion` folder will be generated in the current folder. 
    
Alternatively, to extract the file contents, run in a terminal: 
    
```
tar xvjf aion-{@version}.tar.bz2
```

3. Navigate to the `aion` folder and continue by configuring the network:
    
```
cd aion
```

Please make sure you have the network configurations set as needed before launching the kernel. Steps for setting up network configurations and launching the kernel can be found [here](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/wiki/Aion-Network-Configuration)
