# Overview

Aion core includes a graphical interface, which facilitates kernel management and provides basic wallet functionality.     In Aion v0.2.9, the GUI's first release is available.  As such, there are some [Known issues & Limitations](#known-issues--limitations); please refer to that section for details.

To run the GUI, download and extract the Aion kernel as per the _Getting the Kernel_ step in the [Kernel section of the Aion Owner's Manual](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion/wiki/Aion-Owner's-Manual#kernel).
